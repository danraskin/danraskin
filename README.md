### [Citizen Kanine Scheduling and Invoicing App](https://herokuapp.com/citizen-kanine-demo)

- For instructions on how to explore, see the repo's [README](https://github.com/danraskin/citizenkanineapp-demo/tree/main#readme)

Citizen Kanine is a dog-walking business based in Minneapolis. Each morning, 'Pack Leaders' pick up clients' dogs in along designated routes vans. On a typical day, the business walks 36+ dogs in small groups around Lake Harriet.

This custom React web-application integrates the company's scheduling, invoicing, record-keeping, and communications functions. The app contains two separate workflows: an admin dashboard and a mobile view for employees. The admin portal provides a centralized location for our client to manage employee schedules, client information and scheduling and invoicing. The mobile view allows employees to manage the distribution of dogs along pick-up routes on a daily basis, as well efficiently checking in which dogs were walked each day.

Key Features:

- Employees utilize a 'drag and drop' mobile interface to balance the daily load of dogs
- Employees see the client location in a maps view, allowing single-screen navigation and dog check-ins.
- App syncs client data with Citizen Kanine's Quickbooks account via the Quickbooks API
- App creates formatted Quickbook invoices at the click of a button
- Admin can view client history and submit changes to client schedules

Citizen Kanine currently relies on the production app for its daily operations. Its completed version was developed by myself (Dan Raskin) and Sam Freeman. I am continuing to develop its features in collaboration with the company and its employees. The original prototype was built in a three-week sprint with a team of four other developers: Sarah Preston, Blake Smith, Yanira Hagstrom and Sam Freeman as a part of Prime Digital Academy

### [Interactive "light-to-sound" web audio synth](https://sci-fair-scum.herokuapp.com/)

A collaborative IoT art project built with [Haley Ryan](https://github.com/haley-r). Users control sound usng a simple browser interface. An Adafruit Flora Color Sensor (TCS34725) sends RBG color data to hosted node.js server via python script on RaspberryPi. Users navigate to browser app, which receives live RBG color data. Users control sound by selecting a color, which is converted into sound using an experimental web audio library [i dropped my phone the screen cracked](https://github.com/billorcutt/i_dropped_my_phone_the_screen_cracked) by developer Bill Orcutt.
